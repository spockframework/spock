/**
 * Wraps an existing bean in a Spock spy.
 * <p>
 * Inspired by Springs {@code @SpyBean}, but adapted to Spock semantics.
 * <p>
 * Example: <pre class="code">
 *   &#064;SpringBootTest // &#064;ContextConfiguration works also
 *   class ExampleTests extends Specification {
 *     &#064;SpyBean
 *     Service spiedOnService
 *   }
 *   </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note, that like {@code @SpyBean} this will modify your {@code ApplicationContext}
 * an thus will prevent its reuse for other specs.
 * <p>
 * Only works on fields defined inside a Specification.
 * The field <b>must</b> have the type of the bean to spy upon, {@code def} or {@code Object}
 * fields don't work and will cause an error.
 * Furthermore, there must be an existing bean to wrap, otherwise an error will be thrown.
 * Also, the field <b>must not</b> use an initializer (e.g., {@code Service spiedOnService = Spy()}).
 * <p>
 * Requires at least Spring 4.3.3 to work properly, in earlier versions it should be
 * ignored silently.
