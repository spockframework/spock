= Parallel Execution
include::include.adoc[]

Parallel execution has the potential to reduce the overall test execution time.
By default, Spock runs tests sequentially with a single thread.
As of 2.0 Spock supports parallel execution based on the JUnit Platform.
To enable parallel execution set the `runner.parallel.enabled` property `true`.
See <<extensions.adoc#spock-configuration-file, Spock Configuration File>> for general information about this file.
