/**
 * Listens to block events during the execution of a feature.
 * <p>
 * Usually used in conjunction with {@link org.spockframework.runtime.IRunListener}.
 * Currently, only extensions can register listeners.
 * They do so by invoking {@link org.spockframework.runtime.model.FeatureInfo#addBlockListener(IBlockListener)}.
 * It is preferred to use a single instance of this.
 * <p>
 * It is discouraged to perform long-running operations in the listener methods,
 * as they are called during the execution of the specification.
 * It is discouraged to perform any side effects affecting the tests.
 * <p>
 * When an exception is thrown in a block, the {@code blockExited} will not be called for that block.
 * If a cleanup block is present the cleanup block listener methods will still be called.
