== Spock Framework

Spock is a BDD-style developer testing and specification framework for
Java and https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] applications.To learn more
about Spock, visit
https://spockframework.org[https://spockframework.org].To run a sample
spec in your browser use the
https://gwc-experiment.appspot.com/[Groovy Web Console].

=== Latest Versions

* The latest 2.x release version is *{spock-release-version}* ({spock-release-version}-groovy-2.5,
{spock-release-version}-groovy-3.0, {spock-release-version}-groovy-4.0), released on {spock-release-date}.
* The current development version is *{spock-snapshot-version}-SNAPSHOT*
({spock-snapshot-version}-groovy-2.5-SNAPSHOT, {spock-snapshot-version}-groovy-3.0-SNAPSHOT, , {spock-snapshot-version}-groovy-4.0-SNAPSHOT).

*NOTE:* Spock 2.x is based on the JUnit 5 Platform and require Java
8+/groovy-2.5+ (Groovy 3.0 or 4.0 is recommended, especially in projects using
Java 12+).

Releases are available from
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.spockframework%22[Maven
Central]. Development snapshots are available from
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/spockframework/[Sonatype
OSS].

==== Ad-Hoc Intermediate Releases

For intermediate stable builds we recommend to use
https://jitpack.io/#org.spockframework/spock[Jitpack] (go here for
instructions):

. Add https://jitpack.io[https://jitpack.io] as a repository
. Use `org.spockframework.spock` as `groupId` and the normal
`artifact-id`

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.spockframework.spock:spock-core:spock-{spock-release-version}'
    testImplementation 'org.spockframework.spock:spock-spring:spock-{spock-release-version}'
}
----

[start=3]
. For intermediate releases you can also use the commit-hash as version,
e.g. compile `com.github.spockframework.spock:spock-core:d91bf785a1`

=== Modules

* spock-core -- Core framework. This is the only mandatory module.
* spock-specs -- Specifications for spock-core, implemented using Spock.
Not required for using Spock.
* spock-spring -- Integration with the
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.5.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/testing.html#testcontext-framework[Spring
TestContext Framework].
* spock-tapestry -- Integration with the
https://tapestry.apache.org/[Tapestry 5] IoC container.
* spock-guice -- Integration with https://github.com/google/guice[Guice]
2/3.
* spock-unitils -- Integration with http://www.unitils.org/[Unitils].

=== Building

==== Prerequisites

Spock needs both a JDK 8 and JDK 17+ installed.

* JDK 8 is required to compile Spock via toolchains (automatic download is disabled).
* The gradle build itself requires at least JDK 17 to run.

JDK locations must be made known to toolchains via `JDK<version>=<PATH>` environment
variable, e.g., `JDK8=/path/to/jdk8`.

==== Supported versions

Spock is supported for Java version 8+.

Spock is supported for Groovy versions 2.5, 3.0, and 4.0.

The tests are testing Spock with the specific versions (variants) of
Groovy and Java. Default Groovy version is 2.5.

The Groovy 3.0 and 4.0 variant should pass on all supported JDK versions,
Groovy 2.5 does not work with Java 17+:

....
./gradlew build
....

To build a specific variant of Spock, use the variant name as a parameter

....
./gradlew build -Dvariant=4.0
....

To test against a specific Java version, use the java version name as a parameter, the path to the Java version must be set via an environment variable `JDK<version>=<PATH>`.
Of course, this can combined with the variant selection from above.

....
./gradlew build -DjavaVersion=17
....

(Windows: `gradlew build`). All build dependencies, including the
https://www.gradle.org[build tool] itself, will be downloaded
automatically (unless already present).

=== Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see the
https://github.com/spockframework/spock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contributing
page] for detailed instructions.

=== Support

If you have any comments or questions, please direct them to the
https://github.com/spockframework/spock/discussions[user forum]. All
feedback is appreciated!

=== Java 9 Module Names

All published jars (beginning with Spock 1.2) will contain
Automatic-Module-Name manifest attribute. This allows for Spock to be
used in a Java 9 Module Path.

* spock-core -- `org.spockframework.core`
* spock-spring -- `org.spockframework.spring`
* spock-tapestry -- `org.spockframework.tapestry`
* spock-guice -- `org.spockframework.guice`
* spock-unitils -- `org.spockframework.unitils`

So module authors can use well known module names for the spock modules,
e.g. something like this:

....
open module foo.bar {
  requires org.spockframework.core;
  requires org.spockframework.spring;
}
....
