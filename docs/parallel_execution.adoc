= Parallel Execution
include::include.adoc[]
:xrefstyle: short

WARNING: This is an experimental feature for Spock, which is based on the experimental implementation of parallel execution in the JUnit Platform.

Parallel execution has the potential to reduce the overall test execution time.
The actual achievable reduction will heavily depend on the respective codebase and can vary wildly.

By default, Spock runs tests sequentially with a single thread.
As of version 2.0, Spock supports parallel execution based on the JUnit Platform.
To enable parallel execution set the `runner.parallel.enabled` configuration to `true`.
See <<extensions.adoc#spock-configuration-file, Spock Configuration File>> for general information about this file.

NOTE: JUnit Jupiter also supports  https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.7.0/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel execution], both rely on the JUnit Platform implementation, but function independently of each other.
      If you enable parallel execution in Spock it won't affect Jupiter and vice versa.
      The JUnit Platform executes the test engines (Spock, Jupiter) sequentially, so there should not be any interference between engines.

[[execution-modes]]
== Execution modes
Spock supports two execution modes `SAME_THREAD` and `CONCURRENT`.
You can define the execution mode explicitly for a specification or feature via the `@Execution` annotation.
Otherwise, Spock will use the value of `defaultSpecificationExecutionMode` and `defaultExecutionMode` respectively, both have `CONCURRENT` as default value.
Certain <<extensions.adoc#extensions, extensions>> also set execution modes when they are applied.

* `defaultSpecificationExecutionMode` controls what execution mode a specification will use by default.
* `defaultExecutionMode` controls what execution mode a feature and its iterations (if data driven) will use by default.

==== Execution Mode Inheritance

If nothing else is explicit configured, specifications will use `defaultSpecificationExecutionMode` and features use `defaultExecutionMode`.
However, this changes when you set the execution mode explicitly via `@Execution`.
Each node (specification, feature) checks first if it has an explicit execution mode set,
otherwise it will check its parents for an explicit setting and fall back to the respective defaults otherwise.

The following examples have `defaultSpecificationExecutionMode=SAME_THREAD` and `defaultExecutionMode=SAME_THREAD`.
If you invert the values `SAME_THREAD` and `CONCURRENT` in these examples you will get the inverse result.

<<figure-execution-hierarchy-inheritance-spec-feature-execution>> showcases the combined application of `@Execution` on a specification and some of its features.
As in the previous example the specification and its features will execute concurrently except `testB1` since it has its own explicit execution mode set.

== Resource Locks

With parallel execution comes a new set of challenges for testing, as shared state can be modified and consumed by multiple tests at the same time.

A simple example would be two features that test the use a system property, both setting it to a specific value in the respective `given` block and then executing the code to test the expected behavior.
If they run sequentially then both complete without issue. However, if the run at the same time both `given` blocks will run before the `when` blocks and one feature will fail since the system property did not contain the expected value.

The above example could simply be fixed if both features are part of the same specification by setting them to run in the same thread with `@Execution(SAME_THREAD)`.
However, this is not really practicable when the features are in separate specifications.
To solve this issue Spock has support to coordinate access to shared resources via `@ResourceLock` and `@ResourceLockChildren`.

With `@ResourceLock` you can define both a `key` and a `mode`. By default, `@ResourceLock` assumes `ResourceAccessMode.READ_WRITE`, but you can weaken it to `ResourceAccessMode.READ`.

* `ResourceAccessMode.READ_WRITE` will enforce exclusive access to the resource.
* `ResourceAccessMode.READ` will prevent any `READ_WRITE` locks, but will allow other `READ` locks.

`READ`-only locks will isolate tests from others that modify the shared resource, while at the same time allowing tests that also only read the resource to execute.
You should not modify the shared resource when you only hold a `READ` lock, otherwise the assurances don't hold.

Certain <<extensions.adoc#extensions, extensions>> also set implicit locks when they are applied.

=== Lock inheritance

If a parent node has a lock, it forces its children to run in the same thread.
As `READ_WRITE` locks cause serialized execution anyway, this is effectively not different from what would happen if the lock would be applied to every child directly.
However, if only `READ` locks are used, then it makes a difference whether the lock is acquired on the parent or each child.

If you want to have a lock on all features it might be intuitive to apply `@ResourceLock` on the specification.
However, with this you are actually applying the lock on the Specification level and force every feature to `SAME_THREAD` execution.
To avoid this you can use `@ResourceLockChildren` on the specification, this behaves the same as applying `@ResourceLock` on every feature.
As mentioned before, you will only notice a real difference if you are using `@ResourceLockChildren` with `READ`-only locks, as they allow concurrent execution.

=== Lock coarsening

To avoid deadlocks, Spock pulls up locks to the specification, when locks are defined on both the specification and features.
The Specification will then contain all defined locks.
If the features both had `READ_WRITE` and `READ` locks for the same resource, then the `READ` will be merged into the `READ_WRITE`.

=== Isolated Execution

Sometimes, you want to modify and test something that affects every other feature, you could put a `READ` `@ResourceLock` on _every_ feature, but that is impractical.
The `@Isolated` extension enforces, that only this feature runs without any other features running at the same time.
You can think of this as an implicit global lock.

As with other locks, the features in an `@Isolated` specification will run in `SAME_THREAD` mode.
`@Isolated` can only be applied at the specification level so if you have a large specification and only need it for a few features,
you might want to consider splitting the spec into `@Isolated` and non isolated.

[[parallel-thread-pool]]
== Parallel Thread Pool

With parallel execution enabled, specifications and features can execute concurrently.
You can control the size of the thread pool that executes the features.
Spock uses `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()` to determine the available processors.

* `dynamic(BigDecimal factor)` - Computes the desired parallelism based on the number of available processors multiplied by the `factor` and rounded down to the nearest integer.
  For example a factor of `0.5` will use half your processors.
* `dynamicWithReservedProcessors(BigDecimal factor, int reservedProcessors)` - Same as `dynamic` but ensures that the given amount of `reservedProcessors` is not used.
  The `reservedProcessors` are counted against the available cores not the result of the factor.
* `fixed(int parallelism)` - Uses the given amount of threads.
* `custom(int parallelism, int minimumRunnable, int maxPoolSize, int corePoolSize, int keepAliveSeconds)` - Allows complete control over the threadpool.
  However, it should only be used when the other options are insufficient, and you need that extra bit of control.
  Check the Javadoc of `spock.config.ParallelConfiguration` for a detailed description the parameters.

By default, Spock uses `dynamicWithReservedProcessors(1.0, 2)` that is all your logical processors minus `2`.

If the calculated parallelism is less than `2`, then Spock will execute single threaded, basically the same as `runner.parallel.enabled=false`.
