/**
 * Registers mock/stub/spy as a spring bean in the test context.
 * <p>
 * Inspired by Springs {@code @MockBean}, but adapted to Spock semantics.
 * <p>
 * Example: <pre class="code">
 *   &#064;SpringBootTest // &#064;ContextConfiguration works also
 *   class ExampleTests extends Specification {
 *     &#064;SpringBean
 *     Service mockService = Mock()
 *
 *     &#064;SpringBean
 *     Service stubService = Stub() {
 *       stubCall() >> "default interaction can be defined to"
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;SpringBean
 *     Service spyService = Spy()
 *   }
 *   </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note, that like {@code @MockBean} this will modify your {@code ApplicationContext}
 * an thus will prevent its reuse for other specs.
 * <p>
 * The created mocks belong to the specification and will not work outside of it.
 * <p>
 * Only works on fields defined inside a Specification.
 * The field <b>must</b> have the type of the mock, {@code def} or {@code Object}
 * fields don't work and will cause an error.
 * Also, the field <b>must</b> use an initializer (e.g., {@code Service mockService = Mock()})
 * assigning a value in {@code setup} doesn't work and will cause an error.
 * <p>
 * Requires at least Spring 4.3.3 to work properly, in earlier versions it should be
 * ignored silently.
