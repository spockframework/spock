* Surprising us with some other form of contribution!

All forms of contribution are very much appreciated.

== Communication

Good communication makes a big difference.
We are always eager to listen, reflect, and discuss.
Don't hesitate to get in touch via the https://issues.spockframework.org[issue tracker], https://github.com/spockframework/spock/discussions[discussions], or https://gitter.im/spockframework/spock[gitter].
Choose whatever medium feels most appropriate.

== Triage Issues image:https://www.codetriage.com/spockframework/spock/badges/users.svg[Open Source Helpers,link=https://www.codetriage.com/spockframework/spock]

You can triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for vital information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions.
If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to https://www.codetriage.com/spockframework/spock[subscribe to Spock on CodeTriage].

== Contributing Code/Docs

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a pull request to the https://github.com/spockframework/spock[GitHub repository].

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is to look for and tackle low-hanging fruits in the https://issues.spockframework.org[issue tracker].
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly <<Communication,get in touch>> with us.
This will help to make sure that the contribution is aligned with Spock's overall direction and goals, and gives us a chance to guide design and implementation where needed.

IMPORTANT: *We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in the queue for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all!*

=== What Makes a Good Pull Request

When reviewing pull requests, we value the following qualities (in no particular order):

* Carefully crafted, clean, and concise code
* Small, focused commits that tackle one thing at a time
* New code blends in well with existing code, respecting established coding standards and practices
* Tests are updated/added along with the code, communicate intent, and cover important cases (see <<Tests,Tests>> for additional information)
* Documentation (Javadoc, Groovydoc, reference documentation, release notes) is updated/added along with the code
* A good commit message that follows the https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[seven rules]

Don't be intimidated by these words.
Pull requests that satisfy Spock's overall direction and goals (see above), are crafted carefully, and aren't aiming too high, have a good chance of getting accepted.
Before doing so, we may ask for some concrete improvements to be made, in which case we hope for your cooperation.

=== Guiding Principles

==== Try to avoid breaking stuff

Spock has been around for a long time, and people have built a large suite of tests that rely on Spock.
People want their tests to fail if they make an error; they don't want to update their tests because their testing framework broke stuff.

Unless there is a compelling reason to break something, don't do it.
The potential impact also has to be considered, if the change only affects a niche use-case then it is easier to include than something that breaks every use-case.

If a behavior has been around long enough it might become a https://xkcd.com/1172/[feature], even if that was never intended or was even a bug.
In some cases, we will decide to keep the existing behavior, even if we'd do it differently when starting from a blank slate.

==== Can it be solved with an extension instead?

Don't add specialized code to `spock-core` if it can be achieved by Spock's powerful extension system.

If it is not possible at the moment, can the extension system be improved so that it can cover this use-case instead?

===== Can it be a third-party extension?

Spock has a fair number of built-in extensions, and we want to keep this number limited as each extension will increase the maintenance burden.

You can find a list of third-party extensions in the https://github.com/spockframework/spock/wiki/Third-Party-Extensions[Spock Wiki], and it is easy to get yours added as well.

=== Code Standards

A non-exhaustive list :

* Indent with 2 spaces (should already be set by `.editorconfig`)
* One-line `if` expression can only be used as a `return` guard, e.g., `if (!ok) return;`.
  For other cases, put the body next to the line and add braces.
* Prefer to use `Type mock = Mock()` instead of `def mock = Mock(Type)` unless you are explicitly testing the other syntax.
* Add a blank line before a block label, excluding the first block in a feature.
+
[source,groovy]
----
def "a feature"() {
  given:
  def a = 1

  expect:
  a == 1
}
----
* Don't put code in the same line as a block label.
* Use `given` instead of `setup`
* Don't add `noExceptionThrown()` if other assertions are present.
* Use explicit parameter types when using non-primitive data variables unless you are explicitly testing the other syntax.
* If you use unroll patterns, prefer to have a feature name describing the general use case and use the `@Unroll` extension to provide the pattern for the iteration.
+
[source,groovy]
----
@Unroll("adding #a and #b gives #c")
def "testing addition"() {
  // ...
}
----
+
This pattern gives a better test report, as the intermediate node will be the non-templated feature name.


=== Implementation Language

The implementation language for the https://github.spockframework.org/spock/tree/master/spock-core[spock-core] module is Java.
Java is also the default language for all other modules (except `spock-specs`), but it's fine to use Groovy when there is a concrete reason.
As a general guideline, use the same language as the surrounding code.

=== Compatibility

Spock supports JRE 8 and higher.
Therefore, language features and APIs that are only available in Java 9 or higher cannot be used.
Exceptions to this rule need to be discussed beforehand.
The same goes for changes to user-visible behavior.

=== Tests

All tests are written in Spock. Tests for `spock-core` are located in the `spock-specs` project; all other projects have co-located tests.
A functional test is required for each user-visible behavior.
Functional tests for `spock-core` are located under https://github.spockframework.org/spock/tree/master/spock-specs/src/test/groovy/org/spockframework/smoke[`spock-specs/src/test/groovy/org/spockframework/smoke`].

== Development Tools

=== Command Line Build

Spock is built with https://www.gradle.org[Gradle].
The only prerequisite for executing the build is an installation of JDK 11 and JDK 17.
The build itself must be run with JDK 17, but JDK 11 must be available via toolchain.
You can check if Gradle can locate the necessary JDKs by running `./gradlew javaToolchains`.
If Gradle can't locate your JDK 11, you can make the location of the JDK 11 available via an environment variable called `JDK11`.

After cloning the https://github.com/spockframework/spock[GitHub repository], cd into the top directory and execute `./gradlew build`. The build should succeed without any errors. `./gradlew tasks` lists the available tasks.
Always use the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew` command) rather than your own Gradle installation.

=== CI Build

Each push to the official GitHub repository triggers a https://builds.spockframework.org[Linux CI build] and https://winbuilds.spockframework.org[Windows CI build].
Pull requests are built as well.

=== IDE Setup

Using an IDE is recommended but not mandatory.
Whether or not you use an IDE, please make sure that `./gradlew build` (even better `./allVariants build`) succeeds before submitting a pull request.

==== IntelliJ IDEA

The latest IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition) is the *preferred* IDE for developing Spock.
To generate an IDEA project configuration:

* `./gradlew cleanIdea idea`, followed by
* `File -&gt; Open` in Intellij, then
* select the appropriate `spock-2.5.ipr`.

NOTE: You can provide an optional 'variant' flag to the gradle build `-Dvariant=[2.5|3.0|4.0]` that specifies the version of groovy you wish to use.
For example, if we wish to use groovy 3.0, we would run `./gradlew cleanIdea idea -Dvariant=3.0` and import the generated `spock-3.0.ipr` into Intellij.
You can also use the helper script `allVariants`, e.g., `./allVariants idea`, which will create or update the project for all three variants.

This should result in a fully functional IDE setup where:

* Git VCS integration is configured
* Important formatter settings are configured (e.g. two spaces indent)
* Both Java and Groovy code compiles without problems
* All tests can be run without problems

From time to time (e.g. when someone has added a new dependency), it may be necessary to re-sync the IDEA project with the Gradle build.
This is done by re-running the steps above.

Note: Unfortunately there are currently https://github.com/spockframework/spock/issues/70[some issues] with Intellij's Gradle support that prevent integration with the Spock project.
Please use the method described above rather than importing the top-level `build.gradle` file.

==== Eclipse

Eclipse 3.7+ with the latest https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki[Groovy plugin] should work reasonably well for developing Spock.
To import the Gradle build into Eclipse, either run `./gradlew eclipse` and import the generated Eclipse projects via `File-&gt;Import-&gt;General-&gt;Existing Project into Workspace`, or install the https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle/[Eclipse Gradle Tooling] and import via `File-&gt;Import-&gt;Gradle-&gt;Gradle Project`.
Either method should result in an IDE setup where:

* Both Java and Groovy code compiles without problems
* All tests can be run without problems

From time to time (e.g. when someone has added a new dependency), it may be necessary to resync the Eclipse project with the Gradle build.
Depending on the method of import (see above), this is done by re-running `./gradlew [cleanEclipse] eclipse` and then refreshing all Eclipse projects (F5), or by selecting `Gradle-&gt;Refresh All` in the Package Explorer's context menu.

If you encounter any problems with the IDE setup, or want to make some improvements to it, please <<Communication,get in touch>> with us.
