/**
 * Indicates that a spec's feature methods should be run sequentially
 * in their declared order (even in the presence of a parallel spec runner),
 * always starting from the first method. If a method fails, the remaining
 * methods will be skipped. Feature methods declared in super- and subspecs
 * are not affected.
 *
 * <p><tt>&#64;Stepwise</tt> is useful for specs with
 * (logical) dependencies between methods. In particular, it helps to avoid
 * consecutive errors after a method has failed, which makes it easier to
 * understand what really went wrong.
 *
 * <p>Note: If this extension is applied on the Specification, then it will use
 * {@link org.spockframework.runtime.model.parallel.ExecutionMode#SAME_THREAD}
 * for the whole Spec.
