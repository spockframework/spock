  /**
   * Used to match a value against a (Hamcrest) matcher.
   * Only allowed in places where a condition is expected
   * (expect-block, then-block, after an 'assert' keyword).
   *
   * <p>Basic example:
   *
   * <pre>
   * import static spock.util.matcher.HamcrestSupport.that
   * import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.equalTo // ships with JUnit
   *
   * def foo = 42
   *
   * expect:
   * that(foo, equalTo(42))
   * </pre>
   *
   * Note that Spock supports an even simpler syntax for applying matchers:
   *
   * <pre>
   * expect:
   * foo equalTo(42)
   * </pre>
   *
   * However, the simpler syntax cannot be used in explicit conditions
   * (i.e. after the 'assert' keyword), and may not be as IDE-friendly.
   * That's why this method is provided as an alternative.
   *
   * <h3>When would I use matchers?</h3>
   *
   * <p>Due to Spock's good diagnostic messages and Groovy's expressivity,
   * matchers are less often needed than when, say, writing JUnit tests
   * in Java. However, they come in handy when more complex conditions
   * are required (and possibly repeated throughout a project).
   * In such cases, Spock's Hamcrest integration provides the best of two worlds:
   * the diagnostic messages known from Spock's conditions, and the
   * custom failure messages of Hamcrest matchers.
   *
   * <h3>Third-party matchers</h3>
   *
   * <p>The matchers that ship with JUnit aren't very useful per se.
   * Instead, you will want to use matchers from Hamcrest
   * (https://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/) or other libraries. Both Hamcrest
   * 1.1 and 1.2 are supported. You can also write your own matchers,
   * building up a matcher library that's specific to the needs of your project.
   *
   * @param value the actual value
   * @param matcher a matcher describing the expected value
   * @param <T> the actual value's type
