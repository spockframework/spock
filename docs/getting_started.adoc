== Spock Example Project

To try Spock in your local environment, clone or download/unzip the {spock-example-project}[Spock Example Project].
It comes with fully working Ant, Gradle, and Maven builds that require no further setup. The Gradle build even bootstraps
Gradle itself and gets you up and running in Eclipse or IDEA with a single command. See the README for detailed instructions.
