/**
 * Ignores the annotated spec, feature or selected iterations if the given condition holds.
 * Same as {@link Requires} except that the condition is inverted.
 *
 * <p>The configured closure is called with a delegate of type {@link PreconditionContext}
 * which provides access to system properties, environment variables, the type
 * of operating system and JVM.
 *
 * <p>If applied to a data driven feature, the closure can also access the data variables.
 * If the closure does not reference any actual data variables or is applied to a spec,
 * the whole annotated element is skipped up-front, no fixtures, data providers or anything
 * else will be executed. But if the closure actually does reference valid data variables,
 * the whole workflow is followed up to the feature method invocation, where then the closure
 * is checked and it is decided whether to abort the specific iteration or not.
