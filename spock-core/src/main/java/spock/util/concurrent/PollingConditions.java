/**
 * Repeatedly evaluates one or more conditions until they are satisfied or a timeout has elapsed.
 * The timeout and delays between evaluation attempts are configurable. All durations are in seconds.
 *
 * <p>Usage example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * def conditions = new PollingConditions(timeout: 10, initialDelay: 1.5, factor: 1.25)
 * def machine = new Machine()
 *
 * when:
 * machine.start()

 * then:
 * conditions.eventually {
 *   assert machine.temperature >= 100
 *   assert machine.efficiency >= 0.9
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Warning! Avoiding assert keyword in the clojure is only possible if the conditions object type is known
 * during compilation (no "def" on the left side):
 * <pre>
 *   PollingConditions conditions = new PollingConditions(timeout: 10, initialDelay: 1.5, factor: 1.25)
