description = "Spock is a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. \
What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive specification language. \
Thanks to its JUnit runner, Spock is compatible with most IDEs, build tools, and continuous integration servers. \
Spock is inspired from JUnit, jMock, RSpec, Groovy, Scala, Vulcans, and other fascinating life forms."
