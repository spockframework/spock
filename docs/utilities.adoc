[[mutable-clock]]
== Testing Time with `MutableClock`

When working with dates or time we often have the problem of writing stable tests.
Java only provides a `FixedClock` for testing.
However, often time related code has to deal with the change of time,
so a fixed clock is not enough or makes the test harder to follow.

The prerequisite for using both `FixedClock` and Spocks `MutableClock` is that the production code,
actually uses a configurable `Clock` and not just the parameterless `Instant.now()`
or the corresponding methods in the other `java.time.*` classes.

=== Example

.Class under Test
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/utilities/AgeFilter.java[tag=age-filter-class]
----
<1> `Clock` is injected via constructor
<2> `Clock` is used to get the current date

.Test
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/utilities/MutableClockDocSpec.groovy[tag=age-filter-spec]
----
<1> `MutableClock` created with a well known time
<2> `Clock` is injected via constructor
<3> `age` is less than `18` so the result is `false`
<4> the clock is advanced by one day
<5> `age` is equal to `18` so the result is `true`

There are many more ways to modify `MutableClock` just have a look at the JavaDocs, or the test code `spock.util.time.MutableClockSpec`.

[[async-conditions]]
== Evaluating conditions asynchronously with `AsyncConditions`

The utility class `AsyncConditions` can be helpful when working with asynchronous assertions. These are assertions made
from a different thread than the one running the test, for example when working with callback functions.
The individual assertions are collected using the `evaluate` method, and in the asserting block, e.g. `then`, the
`await` method is called to verify the results, blocking until a timeout expires, and failing if any of the evaluations
failed.
The timeout in seconds can be specified as a parameter, see the example below. The default is `1.0` seconds.
Additionally, the number of expected evaluations must be provided initially, the default value is `1`.

NOTE: In order to use implicit assertions, a typed instance of this class must be declared. When declaring an untyped
instance (using the `def` keyword), it is required to explicitly `assert` all statements inside the block (see example
below).

=== Example

.Test
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/utilities/concurrent/AsyncConditionsDocSpec.groovy[tag=async-conditions-spec]
----
<1> create a default `AsyncConditions` object (expecting a single evaluation)
<2> A new thread is created, and code is passed to be run from it. This could also happen implicitly, when working with
a method expecting a callback parameter.
<3> Pass any code that wants to do assertions to the `evaluate` method. Because we declared the instance of
`AsyncConditions` using the `def` keyword, we have to use `assert` explicitly.
<4> finally, call the `await` method

<5> Create an `AsyncConditions` object (expecting three evaluations). This time we are using a statically typed
instance.
<6> Call `evaluate` multiple times. Using a typed instance above allows using implicit assertions (no `assert` keyword).
keyword.
<7> call `await` in the end, specifying 2.5 seconds as the timeout

[[polling-conditions]]
== Polling until conditions are fulfilled with `PollingConditions`

The `PollingConditions` utility can be used to (repeatedly) check on asynchronous conditions. The difference compared to
`AsyncConditions` is that the result is obtained passively, there is no `await` method.
`PollingConditions` allows to configure the timeout, delay and a delay increasing factor for the checks. Any number of
code blocks are passed to the `eventually` method, which will evaluate them, according to given time parameters, and
either pass or throw one of the appropriate Spock exceptions.
The `within` method can be used to override the timeout for a single invocation. See the second example below for a more
complicated use case.

NOTE: The same restriction when using the `def` keyword exists here also, see the note on `AsyncConditions`

=== Example

.Test
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/utilities/concurrent/PollingConditionsDocSpec.groovy[tag=polling-conditions-spec]
----
<1> create a `PollingConditions` object
<2> values are set to variables in an asynchronous way
<3> block(s) of code containing assertions, passed in a `when` step
<4> verify the result by checking for exceptions
<5> Override the timeout for a single invocation. Using `expect` (or `then`) here forces immediate evaluation.
<6> only the first failed evaluation will be reported

[[blocking-variables]]
== Evaluating asynchronous variables with `BlockingVariable` and `BlockingVariables`

The two utility classes `BlockingVariable` and `BlockingVariables` are there to help with collecting variables that are
written asynchronously, e.g. from another thread. Reading the variable(s) will block the current thread until a value is
available and returned.
For a single variable, a type parameter can be provided, see the example below.
An instance of `BlockingVariables` allows setting properties to it dynamically, and comparisons (i.e. assertions) can be
made for the individual properties, accessing them by their name.
The maximum amount of seconds to wait for can be specified as a parameter, the default is `1.0` seconds.

=== Example

.Test
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/utilities/concurrent/BlockingVariablesDocSpec.groovy[tag=blocking-variables-spec]
----
<1> create a `BlockingVariable` object, providing an optional type parameter
<2> A new thread is created, and immediately put to sleep for some time. Afterwards it will set the value.
<3> The value is accessed via the `get` method. This happens immediately, as the main thread is never interrupted. The
method will block until the value is available.

<4> create a `BlockingVariables` object for multiple variables, providing an optional timeout
<5> set values for `foo`, `bar` and `baz` at some point in the future
<6> compare the individual properties, blocking this thread until they are available
