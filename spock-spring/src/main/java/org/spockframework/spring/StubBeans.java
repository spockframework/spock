/**
 * Adds one or more plain Stubs to the ApplicationContext.
 *
 * Use this if you just need to satisfy some dependencies without
 * actually doing anything with these stubs.
 * <p>
 * If you need to control the stubs, e.g., configure return values
 * then use {@link SpringBean} instead.
 * <p>
 * Like {@link SpringBean} {@link StubBeans} also replaced existing BeanDefinitions,
 * so you can use it to remove real beans from an ApplicationContext.
 * <p>
 * {@link StubBeans} can be replaced by {@link SpringBean}, this can be useful
 * if you need to replace some {@link StubBeans} defined in a parent class.
