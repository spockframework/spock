/**
 * Alternative to class <tt>BlockingVariable(s)</tt> that allows to evaluate conditions
 * in a thread other than the spec runner's thread(s). Rather than transferring
 * state to an expect- or then-block, it is verified right where it is captured.
 * On the upside, this can result in a more informative stack trace if the
 * evaluation of a condition fails. On the downside, the coordination between
 * threads is more explicit (number of <tt>evaluate</tt> blocks has to be specified if
 * greater than one), and the usual structure of a feature method cannot be
 * preserved (conditions are no longer located in expect-/then-block).
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 * // create object under specification
 * def machine = new Machine()
 *
 * def conds = new AsyncConditions()
 *
 * // register async callback
 * machine.workDone << { result ->
 *   conds.evaluate {
 *     assert result == WorkResult.OK
 *     // could add more explicit conditions here
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * when:
 * machine.start()
 *
 * then:
 * // wait for the evaluation to complete
 * // any exception thrown in the evaluate block will be rethrown from this method
 * conds.await()
 *
 * cleanup:
 * // shut down all threads
 * machine?.shutdown()
 * <pre>
