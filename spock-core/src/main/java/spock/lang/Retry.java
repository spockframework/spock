/**
 * Retries the given feature if an exception occurs during execution.
 *
 * <p>Retries can be applied to feature methods and spec classes. Applying it to
 * a spec class has the same effect as applying it to each feature method that
 * isn't already annotated with {@code @Retry}.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Retry} annotations are inherited, i.e. if declared on a superclass
 * of a spec class, it will be applied to all feature methods of both classes
 * unless the subclass declares its own annotation. If so, it is applied to all
 * feature methods declared in the subclass, but not to any feature methods
 * declared in the superclass. In particular, that means that retries are not
 * applied to inherited feature methods if the annotation is only present on the
 * subclass.
