== 1.3 (tbd)

Potential breaking change: assertions with explicit messages now include power assertions output.

.Given
[source,groovy]
----
def a = 1
def b = 2
assert a == b : "Additional message"
----

.Before
----
a == b

Additional message
----

.Now
----
a == b
| |  |
1 |  2
  false

Additional message
----

If you relied on this behavior to hide some output, or to prevent a stack overflow due to a self referenceing
data structure, then you need to move the condition into a separate method that just returns the boolean result.

=== What's New In This release

* Fix erroneous regex where an optional colon was defined instead of a non-capturing group
* Render class loader for classes in comparison failures
* Record class literal values to display FQCN in comparison failures
* Filter Java 9+ reflection stack frames
* Do not convert implicit "this" expression like when calling the constructor of a non-static inner class
* Fix class expression recording when there are comments with dots in the same line
* Show stacktrace of throwables in comparison failure result
* Use canonical class name in comparison failure results if present
* Render otherwise irrelevant expressions if they get a type hint in comparison failure
* Add identity hash code to type hints in comparison failures if they are identical

Thanks to all the contributors to this release: Jochen Berger, Leonard Brünings, Mariusz Gilewicz, Tomasz Juchniewicz, Gamal Mateo, Tobias Schulte, Florian Wilhelm, Kevin Wittek

== 1.1-rc-1 (released 2016-06-30)

A number of excellent pull requests have been integrated into the 1.1 stream.
Currently some features are incubating.
We encourage users to try out these new features and provide feedback so we can finalize the content for a 1.1 release.

=== What's New In This release

* 44 merged pull requests
* The `verifyAll` method can be used to assert multiple boolean expressions _without_ short-circuiting those after a failure.
For example:
[source,groovy]
----
then:
verifyAll {
  a == b
  b == c
}
----
* Detached mocks via the `DetachedMockFactory` and `SpockMockFactoryBean` classes see the <<module_spring.adoc#_spring_module,Spring Module Docs>>.
* Cells in a data table can refer to the current value for a column to the left.
* `Spy` can be used to create partial mocks for Java 8 interfaces with `default` methods just as it can for abstract classes.
* Improved power assert output when an exception occurs evaluating an assertion.
* A new `@PendingFeature` annotation to distinguish incomplete functionality from features with `@Ignore`.

== 1.0 (released 2015-03-02)

1.0 has arrived! Finally (and some years late) the version number communicates what
https://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/WhoIsUsingSpock[Spock users] have known for ages - that Spock isn't only useful
and fun, but also reliable, mature, and here to stay. So please, go out and tell everyone who hasn't been assimilated
that now is the time to join the party!

A special thanks goes to all our tireless speakers and supporters, only a few of which are listed here: Andres Almiray,
Cédric Champeau, David Dawson, Rob Fletcher, Sean Gilligan, Ken Kousen, Guillaume Laforge,

== 0.7 (released 2012-10-08)

=== Snapshot Repository Moved

Spock snapshots are now available from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/spockframework/.

=== New Reference Documentation

The new Spock reference documentation is available at http://docs.spockframework.org.
It will gradually replace the documentation at http://wiki.spockframework.org.
Each Spock version is documented separately (e.g. http://docs.spockframework.org/en/spock-0.7-groovy-1.8).
Documentation for the latest Spock snapshot is at http://docs.spockframework.org/en/latest.
As of Spock 0.7, the chapters on <<data_driven_testing.adoc#,Data Driven Testing>> and
<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#,Interaction Based Testing>> are complete.

=== Improved Mocking Failure Message for `TooManyInvocationsError`

The diagnostic message accompanying a `TooManyInvocationsError` has been greatly improved.
Here is an example:

----
Too many invocations for:

3 * person.sing(_)   (4 invocations)

Matching invocations (ordered by last occurrence):

2 * person.sing("do")   <-- this triggered the error
1 * person.sing("re")
1 * person.sing("mi")
----

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#_verification_of_interactions,Reference Documentation>>

=== Improved Mocking Failure Message for `TooFewInvocationsError`

The diagnostic message accompanying a `TooFewInvocationsError` has been greatly improved.
Here is an example:

----
Too few invocations for:

1 * person.sing("fa")   (0 invocations)

Unmatched invocations (ordered by similarity):

1 * person.sing("re")
1 * person.say("fa")
1 * person2.shout("mi")
----

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#_verification_of_interactions,Reference Documentation>>

=== Stubs

Besides mocks, Spock now has explicit support for stubs:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = Stub(Person)
----

A stub is a restricted form of mock object that responds to invocations without ever demanding them.
Other than not having a cardinality, a stub's interactions look just like a mock's interactions.
Using a stub over a mock is an effective way to communicate its role to readers of the specification.

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#Stubs,Reference Documentation>>

=== Spies

Besides mocks, Spock now has support for spies:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = Spy(Person, constructorArgs: ["Fred"])
----

A spy sits atop a real object, in this example an instance of class `Person`. All invocations on the spy
that don't match an interaction are delegated to that object. This allows to listen in on and selectively
change the behavior of the real object. Furthermore, spies can be used as partial mocks.

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#Spies,Reference Documentation>>


=== Declaring Interactions at Mock Creation Time

Interactions can now be declared at mock creation time:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = Mock(Person) {
    sing() >> "tra-la-la"
    3 * eat()
}
----

This feature is particularly attractive for <<Stubs>>.

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#Stubs,Reference Documentation>>

=== Groovy Mocks

Spock now offers specialized mock objects for spec'ing Groovy code:

[source,groovy]
----
def mock = GroovyMock(Person)
def stub = GroovyStub(Person)
def spy = GroovySpy(Person)
----

A Groovy mock automatically implements `groovy.lang.GroovyObject`. It allows stubbing and mocking
of dynamic methods just like for statically declared methods. When a Groovy mock is called from Java
rather than Groovy code, it behaves like a regular mock.

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#GroovyMocks,Reference Documentation>>

=== Global Mocks

A Groovy mock can be made _global_:

[source,groovy]
----
GroovySpy(Person, global: true)
----

A global mock can only be created for a class type. It effectively replaces all instances of that type and makes them
amenable to stubbing and mocking. (You may know this behavior from Groovy's `MockFor` and `StubFor` facilities.)
Furthermore, a global mock allows mocking of the type's constructors and static methods.

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#MockingAllInstancesOfAType,Reference Documentation>>

=== Grouping Conditions with Same Target Object

Inspired from Groovy's `Object.with` method, the `Specification.with` method allows to group conditions
involving the same target object:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = new Person(name: "Fred", age: 33, sex: "male")

expect:
with(person) {
    name == "Fred"
    age == 33
    sex == "male"
}
----

=== Grouping Interactions with Same Target Object

The `with` method can also be used for grouping interactions:

[source,groovy]
----
def service = Mock(Service)
app.service = service

when:
app.run()

then:
with(service) {
    1 * start()
    1 * act()
    1 * stop()
}
----

<<interaction_based_testing.adoc#_grouping_interactions_with_same_target,Reference Documentation>>

=== Polling Conditions

`spock.util.concurrent.PollingConditions` joins `AsyncConditions` and `BlockingVariable(s)` as another utility for
testing asynchronous code:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = new Person(name: "Fred", age: 22)
def conditions = new PollingConditions(timeout: 10)

when:
Thread.start {
    sleep(1000)
    person.age = 42
    sleep(5000)
    person.name = "Barney"
}

then:
conditions.within(2) {
    assert person.age == 42
}

conditions.eventually {
    assert person.name == "Barney"
}
----

=== Experimental DSL Support for Eclipse

Spock now ships with a DSL descriptor that lets Groovy Eclipse better
understand certain parts of Spock's DSL. The descriptor is automatically
detected and activated by the IDE. Here is an example:

[source,groovy]
----
// currently need to type variable for the following to work
Person person = new Person(name: "Fred", age: 42)

expect:
with(person) {
    name == "Fred" // editor understands and auto-completes 'name'
    age == 42      // editor understands and auto-completes 'age'
}
----

Another example:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = Stub(Person) {
    getName() >> "Fred" // editor understands and auto-completes 'getName()'
    getAge() >> 42      // editor understands and auto-completes 'getAge()'
}
----

DSL support is activated for Groovy Eclipse 2.7.1 and higher. If necessary,
it can be deactivated in the Groovy Eclipse preferences.

=== Experimental DSL Support for IntelliJ IDEA

Spock now ships with a DSL descriptor that lets Intellij IDEA better
understand certain parts of Spock's DSL. The descriptor is automatically
detected and activated by the IDE. Here is an example:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = new Person(name: "Fred", age: 42)

expect:
with(person) {
    name == "Fred" // editor understands and auto-completes 'name'
    age == 42      // editor understands and auto-completes 'age'
}
----

Another example:

[source,groovy]
----
def person = Stub(Person) {
    getName() >> "Fred" // editor understands and auto-completes 'getName()'
    getAge() >> 42      // editor understands and auto-completes 'getAge()'
}
----

DSL support is activated for IntelliJ IDEA 11.1 and higher.

=== Splitting up Class Specification

Parts of class `spock.lang.Specification` were pulled up into two new super classes: `spock.lang.MockingApi`
now contains all mocking-related methods, and `org.spockframework.lang.SpecInternals` contains internal methods
which aren't meant to be used directly.

=== Improved Failure Messages for `notThrown` and `noExceptionThrown`

Instead of just passing through exceptions, `Specification.notThrown` and `Specification.noExceptionThrown`
now fail with messages like:

----
Expected no exception to be thrown, but got 'java.io.FileNotFoundException'

Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: ...
----

=== `HamcrestSupport.expect`

Class `spock.util.matcher.HamcrestSupport` has a new `expect` method that makes
http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/[Hamcrest] assertions read better in then-blocks:

[source,groovy]
----
when:
def x = computeValue()

then:
expect x, closeTo(42, 0.01)
----

=== @Beta

Recently introduced classes and methods may be annotated with `@Beta`, as a sign that they may still undergo incompatible
changes. This gives us a chance to incorporate valuable feedback from our users. (Yes, we need your feedback!) Typically,
a `@Beta` annotation is removed within one or two releases.

=== Fixed Issues

See the https://code.google.com/p/spock/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-0.7[issue tracker] for a list of fixed issues.

== 0.6 (released 2012-05-02)

=== Mocking Improvements

The mocking framework now provides better diagnostic messages in some cases.

Multiple result declarations can be chained. The following causes method bar to throw an `IOException` when first called,
return the numbers one, two, and three on the next calls, and throw a `RuntimeException` for all subsequent calls:

[source,groovy]
----
foo.bar() >> { throw new IOException() } >>> [1, 2, 3] >> { throw new RuntimeException() }
----

It's now possible to match any argument list (including the empty list) with `foo.bar(*_)`.

Method arguments can now be constrained with http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/[Hamcrest] matchers:

[source,groovy]
----
import static spock.util.matcher.HamcrestMatchers.closeTo

...

1 * foo.bar(closeTo(42, 0.001))
----

=== Extended JUnit Rules Support

In addition to rules implementing `org.junit.rules.MethodRule` (which has been deprecated in JUnit 4.9), Spock now also
supports rules implementing the new `org.junit.rules.TestRule` interface. Also supported is the new `@ClassRule`
annotation. Rule declarations are now verified and can leave off the initialization part. I that case Spock will
automatically initialize the rule by calling the default constructor. The `@TestName` rule, and rules in general, now
honor the `@Unroll` annotation and any defined naming pattern.

See https://code.google.com/p/spock/issues/detail?id=240[Issue 240] for a known limitation with Spock's TestRule support.

=== Condition Rendering Improvements

When two objects are compared with the `==` operator, they are unequal, but their string representations are the same,
Spock will now print the objects' types:

----
enteredNumber == 42
|             |
|             false
42 (java.lang.String)
----

=== JUnit Fixture Annotations

Fixture methods can now be declared with JUnit's `@Before`, `@After`, `@BeforeClass`, and `@AfterClass` annotations,
as an addition or alternative to Spock's own fixture methods. This was particularly needed for Grails 2.0 support.

=== Tapestry 5.3 Support

Thanks to a contribution from http://howardlewisship.com/[Howard Lewis Ship], the Tapestry module is now compatible
with Tapestry 5.3. Older 5.x versions are still supported.

=== IBM JDK Support

Spock now runs fine on IBM JDKs, working around a bug in the IBM JDK's verifier.

=== Improved JUnit Compatibility

`org.junit.internal.AssumptionViolatedException` is now recognized and handled as known from JUnit. `@Unrolled` methods
no longer cause "yellow" nodes in IDEs.

[[improved-unroll-0.6]]
=== Improved `@Unroll`

The `@Unroll` naming pattern can now be provided in the method name, instead of as an argument to the annotation:

[source,groovy]
----
@Unroll
def "maximum of #a and #b is #c"() {
    expect:
    Math.max(a, b) == c

    where:
    a | b | c
    1 | 2 | 2
}
----

The naming pattern now supports property access and zero-arg method calls:

[source,groovy]
----
@Unroll
def "#person.name.toUpperCase() is #person.age years old"() { ... }
----

The `@Unroll` annotation can now be applied to a spec class. In this case, all data-driven feature methods in the class
will be unrolled.

=== Improved `@Timeout`

The `@Timeout` annotation can now be applied to a spec class. In this case, the timeout applies to all feature methods
(individually) that aren't already annotated with `@Timeout`. Timed methods are now executed on the regular test
framework thread. This can be important for tests that rely on thread-local state (like Grails integration tests).
Also the interruption behavior has been improved, to increase the chance that a timeout can be enforced.

The failure exception that is thrown when a timeout occurs now contains the stacktrace of test execution, allowing you
to see where the test was “stuck” or how far it got in the allocated time.

=== Improved Data Table Syntax

Table cells can now be separated with double pipes. This can be used to visually set apart expected outputs from
provided inputs:

[source,groovy]
----
...
where:
a | b || sum
1 | 2 || 3
3 | 1 || 4
----

=== Groovy 1.8/2.0 Support

Spock 0.6 ships in three variants for Groovy 1.7, 1.8, and 2.0. Make sure to pick the right version - for example,
for Groovy 1.8 you need to use spock-core-0.6-groovy-1.8 (likewise for all other modules). The Groovy 2.0 variant
is based on Groovy 2.0-beta-3-SNAPSHOT and only available from http://m2repo.spockframework.org. The Groovy 1.7 and
1.8 variants are also available from Maven Central. The next version of Spock will no longer support Groovy 1.7.

=== Grails 2.0 Support

Spock's Grails plugin was split off into a separate project and now lives at http://github.spockframework.org/spock-grails.
The plugin supports both Grails 1.3 and 2.0.

The Spock Grails plugin supports all of the new Grails 2.0 test mixins, effectively deprecating the existing unit
testing classes (e.g. UnitSpec). For integration testing, IntegrationSpec must still be used.

=== IntelliJ IDEA Integration

The folks from http://www.jetbrains.com[JetBrains] have added a few handy features around data tables. Data tables
will now be layed out automatically when reformatting code. Data variables are no longer shown as "unknown" and have
their types inferred from the values in the table (!).

=== GitHub Repository

All source code has moved to http://github.spockframework.org/. The http://github.spockframework.org/spock-grails[Grails Spock plugin],
http://github.spockframework.org/spock-example[Spock Example] project, and
http://github.spockframework.org/spockwebconsole[Spock Web Console] now have their own GitHub projects.
Also available are slides and code for various Spock presentations (such as
http://github.spockframework.org/smarter-testing-with-spock[this one]).

=== Gradle Build

Spock is now exclusively built with Gradle. Building Spock yourself is as easy as cloning the
http://github.spockframework.org/spock[Github repo] and executing `gradlew build`. No build tool installation is
required; the only prerequisite for building Spock is a JDK installation (1.5 or higher).

=== Fixed Issues

See the https://code.google.com/p/spock/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-0.6[issue tracker] for a list of fixed issues.
